Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
            inline elements only take up as much room as needed for their content by default and do not start a new line allowing other elements to sit beside them.
            Block level elements take up the entire width of their parent by default starts a new line not allowing other elements to flow on their left/right side
    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
            It is taken out of the standard flow and can be positioned relative to it's closest ancestor with a position attr other than static. 
    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
            display:inline-block
    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
        block: p, header elements, divs
        inline: spans, button
        inline-block: img tags
    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model? 
        Everything in HTML is a made of of boxes. the standard box model computes the total size of an element by taking it's declared sizing+padding size+border size. So if you had an element with a  width of 100px with 20px of padding and a 5px border your total width is 150px. This can mess up carefully calculated layouts without a ton of extra math.
        The fix is to use "box-sizing:border-box;" This takes any declared  sizing  and subtracts the padding and border from it, so in the above example of 100px width we would subtract 40px+10px from the width. making the content 50px wide and the total size of the box remaing at 100px.
